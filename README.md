# NumPy
This will tell you how to create NumPy arrays (np.array) either through manually creating Vectors(One-Dimension) / Matrices(Two-Dimension) arrays or using random module (rand, randn),arange,linspace, using lists and then converting into NumPy array.
As we are seeing above, there are many other number of ways also to create NumPy arrays. 
Here, in this you will also be able to see many NumPy operations that are used and therefore helps in making Data Science projects!
